- Short-haired pets: Every 4-6 weeks

- Double-coated breeds: Seasonal, especially during shedding periods

### Is my pet too old for grooming?
No pet is too old for grooming! We take special care with senior pets, using gentle techniques and providing extra breaks if needed.

Absolutely! Our groomers are trained to work with anxious pets. We use positive reinforcement and can schedule shorter, more frequent sessions to help your pet become comfortable with the grooming process.
